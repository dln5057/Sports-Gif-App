# SportsGiphyApp

### Sports (or anything else) Fun App full of gifs using the giphy API !!

## Basic Functionality:
* Made an array of sports and made buttons out of them.
* When you click on a button, you get 10 images from giphy and put them on the page.
* A search area allows you to type anything in sports related, and the button will be created to show the giphy.
